Thank you for visiting my website and welcome to my page. Currently I'm a computer science major at the university of memphis with hopes of starting my master's degree next year. I have been engaged in research since I started the CS degree and would love nothing more than to write a thesis as a master's student as I decide whether to pursue a phd or not. Take a look at some of my projects.
